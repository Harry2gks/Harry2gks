☕️ ➜ 💻 From roasting coffee beans to roasting bugs

Hi, I’m Harry. My journey into tech began when I realized that debugging code is basically the same as roasting coffee:

🔥 apply heat → hope for the best → adjust → repeat

---

### 🧠 My daily workflow  
```bash
$ caffeine++;
$ focus++;
$ bugs--;
```
### 🧰 My Toolkit 
```
$ cat stack.txt
- JavaScript   # dangerously dynamic
- Python       # elegantly readable
- C            # pain.asFeature()
- HTML / CSS   # still centering that div
- Git & GitHub # commit early, regret later

```

 ### 🚀 Active Quests
 
```bash
$ npm install react
$ git checkout -b "frontend_wizard"
$ ai-assist --enable
# Tried installing Node.js... now my laptop *is* a space heater ☀️

```
### ⚠️ Fun Facts (Mostly True)
☕ I measure time in coffees, not hours

```bash
# “It worked on my machine”
$ alias coffee = "sudo productivity++"
$ git push --force && hope_for_the_best
```
