☕️ ➜ 💻 From roasting coffee beans to roasting bugs

Hi, I’m Harry. My journey into tech began when I realized that debugging code is basically the same as roasting coffee:

🔥 apply heat → hope for the best → adjust → repeat

---

### 🧠 My daily workflow  
```js
caffeine++;
focus++;
bugs--;
```
### 🧰 My Toolkit

💛 JavaScript - because I like living dangerously

🐍 Python - for when I want my code readable

💀 C - for the days I miss pain

🎨 HTML & CSS - 90% searching “how to center a div”

🌀 Git & GitHub - commit early, regret often

----

 ### 🚀 Current Quests

🧩 Learning React (and occasionally reinventing the wheel)

🔁 Turning “just a small project” into a 3-week refactor

🤖 Letting AI explain my own code back to me

⚔️ Fighting merge conflicts like a true warrior

---

### 💡 What I Actually Love

🧼 Clean UI & smooth UX

🧠 Writing code future-me won’t hate

🛠️ Building things that actually work

🧩 Solving problems before they solve me

---

### ⚠️ Fun Facts (Mostly True)

💬 I comment my code… sometimes

💻 “It worked on my machine” is my mantra

☕ I measure time in coffees, not hours

🦆 Rubber duck debugging: 10/10 would recommend
