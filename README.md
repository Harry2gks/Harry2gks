☕️ ➜ 💻 From roasting coffee beans to roasting bugs

Hi, I’m Harry. My journey into tech began when I realized that debugging code is basically the same as roasting coffee:

🔥 apply heat → hope for the best → adjust → repeat

---

### 🧠 My daily workflow  
```js
caffeine++;
focus++;
bugs--;
```
### 🧰 My Toolkit 
```
> JavaScript --danger
> Python --readable
> C --pain
> git commit -m "it finally works"
```

 ### 🚀 Active Quests
 
```
$ npm install react
$ git checkout -b "frontend_wizard"
$ ai-assist --enable
# Tried installing Node.js... now my laptop *is* a space heater ☀️

```



### ⚠️ Fun Facts (Mostly True)
☕ I measure time in coffees, not hours

```
# “It worked on my machine”
alias coffee = "sudo productivity++"
git push --force && hope_for_the_best
```
